A. Take the quiz posted on the Teams site
B. Accept the github classroom assignment. For each answer create a separate file.

2. Create a file called q2.bat. In that file write a one line unix command that fetches the wikipedia page for Chewbacca and prints out the number of lines containing character string "Han Solo"
